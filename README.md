# Scrap Folder

We use the PHP Simple Html DOM Parser for the web scraping process, and modified
version of rss_feed library. The hole data connector is coded using PHP, but using 
the Wordpress core as database management framework.

The event detection is based on a 100% rising flux change probability.
 
The server cron job will call cron.php several times a day, and the feed wil always
return the last registered events.
